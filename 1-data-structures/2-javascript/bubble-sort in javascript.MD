Bubble sort is a straightforward sorting algorithm in JavaScript that works by repeatedly comparing adjacent elements in an array and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

#simple term
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. 

function bubbleSort(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let swapped;

    do {
        swapped = false;
        for (let i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                // Swap the elements
                let temp = arr[i];
                arr[i] = arr[i + 1];
                arr[i + 1] = temp;
                swapped = true;
            }
        }
    } while (swapped);

    return arr;
}

// Example usage:
const myArray = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11];
const sortedArray = bubbleSort(myArray);
console.log("Sorted array:", sortedArray);
